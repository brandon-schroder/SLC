# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions

## What this is

`slcflow`: a reduced-order, object-oriented, streamline-curvature (SLC)
throughflow solver for turbomachinery preliminary design — axial, radial, and
mixed-flow compressors and turbines, one kernel, multi-fidelity (meanline /
streamline-REE / full SLC) via grid collapse, not separate code paths.

## Read before touching related code

Three documents in `docs/` are the source of truth. Do not re-derive
formulation, architecture, or module-scope decisions from general
turbomachinery knowledge — they are frozen (with open items marked
`[VERIFY]`/`[DECIDE]`) and code must conform to them, not the other way round.

- `docs/theory_manual.md` — governing equations, sign conventions, the master
  q-o momentum equation and its full derivation (Appendix A, **normative for
  signs**), loss/entropy conversions (Appendix B), verification ladder (§9).
- `docs/architecture_specification.md` — package layout, the AD-1..AD-10
  binding decisions (below), interface contracts, solver drivers, milestones
  (ARCH-8).
- `docs/module_specification_geometry_and_grid.md` — scope and test plan for
  `slcflow/geometry` and `slcflow/grid` specifically.

Before writing code in a package, view that package's governing section(s)
above. Before writing code implementing an equation, check the theory manual
section number is cited in a comment or docstring.

## Binding architectural decisions (ARCH-1)

These are not suggestions; violating them is a bug even if tests pass.

- **AD-1** One kernel; fidelity tiers are data (`FidelityConfig`), never
  subclasses or parallel code paths.
- **AD-2** Struct-of-arrays state: nodal fields live in flat `(N_sl, N_qo)`
  arrays; objects describe topology, not data.
- **AD-3** Residual assembly is a **pure function** of `(x, FrozenInputs)` —
  no mutation, no hidden state, no I/O on the residual path.
- **AD-4** Closures are lagged into an immutable `ClosureFields` object per
  outer iterate; closure-in-Newton is a later upgrade behind the same
  interface.
- **AD-5** Machine-type knowledge (loss/deviation/blockage correlations)
  lives only in `slcflow/closures/`; the kernel imports interfaces, never
  implementations. Enforced by `tools/check_imports.py`.
- **AD-6** Numerical forward-compatibility on the residual path: array
  namespace injected via `xp=` (default NumPy, future JAX), no in-place
  mutation of state-derived arrays, no data-dependent Python branching on
  flow arrays (use `slcflow/closures/smoothmath.py` primitives instead).
  Partially enforced by `tools/check_ad6.py` (token-level grep lint — real
  but conservative; false positives get silenced with `# ad6: allow` +
  justification, not deleted).
- **AD-7** SI units, radians, everywhere in code. Degrees only at I/O
  boundaries.
- **AD-8** Q-o topology is immutable per solve; only streamline *positions*
  are state.
- **AD-9** Walls are labeled `wall_0`/`wall_1`, not `hub`/`shroud` — the
  physical mapping is machine-dependent (see theory manual A.1.1). Never
  assume `q=0` is the hub.
- **AD-10** No exceptions on the residual path. Out-of-domain physics
  saturates smoothly and returns validity metadata. Exceptions
  (`slcflow.errors.ConfigError`) are reserved for configuration/construction
  boundaries — raise loudly and early there.

## Process discipline

- **C¹ smoothness (Theory Manual §7.3) is mandatory** for anything in
  `closures/` and anything else touching flow-state arrays: no raw `if` /
  `clip` / `abs` / `min` / `max` on flow quantities. Build from
  `smoothmath.py`. A new primitive needs a test proving it's C¹ by
  refinement-scaling (see `tests/test_smoothmath.py::assert_c1_continuous`
  for the pattern — and its docstring for why naive spike-detection
  heuristics don't work), *and* a negative-control test proving the checker
  actually rejects a known-discontinuous function.
- **Adjudicate code of uncertain provenance before trusting it.** If code
  appears in the workspace that you did not just write this session (stray
  drafts, prior-session output, anything not traceable to a reviewed commit),
  do not silently adopt or extend it. Write an independent test suite derived
  from the relevant spec section *without reading the implementation first*,
  then check it against the code. Only adopt what passes. Record the
  provenance situation in the test file's docstring. This happened once
  already (`tests/test_grid_adjudication.py` is the precedent) — repeat the
  pattern, don't skip it because it's slower.
- **Every module implementing a numbered spec section gets a test tied to
  that section number**, not just to intuited correctness — e.g. a docstring
  or comment reading `(G-8.1)` or `(§5.4)` next to the assertion it verifies.
  This is what lets `docs/` and `tests/` stay synchronized as the ground
  truth instead of drifting apart.
- **Sign conventions are frozen in Theory Manual Appendix A.** If a
  derivation elsewhere in the literature (or in generated code) disagrees
  with Appendix A, the manual wins unless you are explicitly revising the
  manual itself as a reviewed, deliberate edit — never silently flip a sign
  to make a test pass.
- Before considering a module done, run both lints and the full suite:
  `python tools/check_imports.py && python tools/check_ad6.py && pytest -q`.
  All three are also CI gates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); don't rely on CI
  to catch what you can check locally first.

## Current status

- **M0** (scaffold, `smoothmath`, `PerfectGas`) — closed.
- **M1** (geometry/grid: `WallCurve`, `FlowPath`/q-o construction,
  streamline init, metric evaluation) — closed. Acceptance gate
  (frozen-streamline master-ODE vs. analytic bend solution) passing.
- **M0/M1 cleanup audit** — closed (6 commits on `main`, CI-green baseline).
  Covered: repo/environment sanity, naming/layout vs. ARCH-2, test-provenance
  re-check (`test_grid.py`/`test_grid_adjudication.py` split confirmed still
  valid), spec-traceability spot-check, dead-code sweep, and an independent
  `fluid`/`closures` adjudication suite
  (`tests/test_fluid_closures_adjudication.py`) matching the
  `test_grid_adjudication.py` precedent. No open items remain from this pass.
- **M2** (residual assembler + classical driver, Tier 2 vs. analytic radial
  equilibrium V1, grid-convergence check) — closed. Ran as four reviewed
  sub-steps on `main`: (1) `transport/` — §3.3–3.5 conservation relations +
  C¹ work/loss schedules (§3.6 mixing deferred to M8 per ARCH-8/ARCH-9);
  (2) `assembly/` + `slcflow/types.py` — `FrozenInputs` as the single config
  boundary, `ResidualAssembler` (RK2 master ODE over PCHIP distributions,
  §5.3–5.4/§6.1 elimination form, A.7 capacity); (3) `drivers/classical.py`
  + `diagnostics/` — §6.2 nested scheme, typed `SolveStatus` returns
  (ARCH-6), all three §6.2.5 norms recorded; (4) `verification/` — V1
  analytic-REE cases with independent dense references. Acceptance gate
  passing: V1a–V1c regressions + grid-order check, observed order 1.94
  (tolerances in Theory Manual Appendix C.1).
- **M3** (full Tier 3 repositioning, V2/V3 green, Wilkinson constant
  calibrated) — closed. Ran as four reviewed sub-steps on `main`:
  (1) Tier-3 stabilization — §5.5 curvature lag wired as lagged data;
  measured finding: the lag is *mandatory* (not optional) whenever the
  curvature term is active, else the streamwise odd-even mode diverges at
  any ω; crossing-streamline carryover resolved structurally (classical
  repositioning is a convex blend of monotone vectors; Newton-side guard
  is M5). (2) V2 curved annulus vs. planar-limit concentric reference
  (Appendix C.2; `[VERIFY]` remains for an external potential-flow
  cross-check with duct extensions). (3) §6.4 `[VERIFY]` resolved (manual
  v0.3): measured envelope is ω ≤ ~7.3·(Δm_min/L_qo)^1.5 — *not* the
  literature (Δm/Δq)² aspect form; shipped `wilkinson_c = 4.4` (0.6×
  margin); envelope + rerunnable study in Appendix C.3 /
  `tools/calibrate_wilkinson.py`. (4) V3 tier consistency: Tier 2 ≡ Tier 3
  bit-for-bit on straight-annulus vortex cases, asserted at 1e-10 with a
  curved-path non-vacuousness guard (Appendix C.4).
- **M4** (axial-compressor correlation set + Tier 1 mode, V4/V5) — closed.
  Ran as five reviewed sub-steps on `main`: (1) `closures/interfaces.py`
  (ARCH-4.2 protocol layer) + `simple.py` prescribed closures + closure-fed
  blade-row wiring in the driver (AD-4 lagged eval, §6.2.2.4; the carried
  `rvt_le` consistency test landed here). (2) `closures/conversions.py` —
  Appendix B loss→entropy conversions (B.1 rotor re-referencing, B.2/B.3/B.4)
  with the assert-don't-clamp KE guard. (3) `geometry/bladerow.py`
  (`ParamRowGeometry`, C¹-in-span PCHIP) + `closures/axial_compressor/
  lieblein.py` — Lieblein/SP-36 incidence/deviation (Aungier fits), and the
  §6.2.4 closure under-relaxation discovered *necessary* here (the swirl↔
  continuity Picard loop diverges otherwise). (4) `axial_compressor/loss.py`
  — equivalent-diffusion profile loss + `LIEBLEIN_NACA65` CorrelationSet;
  measured `closure_relax = 0.25` (0.5 diverges), §7.3.2 ω̄ ceiling to keep
  B.2 in-domain, and an AD-10 gap closed (negative-Vm repositioning → typed
  `NUMERICAL_FAILURE`). (5) `machine/` facade (ARCH-5.5,
  `Machine.evaluate → PerformanceResult`) + the n_sl = 1 **Tier-1 meanline**
  (lifts the `ResidualAssembler` n_sl ≥ 2 constraint; one-point area rule as
  the coarsest §5.4 quadrature, repositioning off — one kernel, no tier
  branch per AD-1), the V3 Tier-1 mass-average clause (Appendix C.4), and the
  V5 axial-compressor entry point. **V4/V5 status is structural** (anchors,
  trends, bands, C¹ sweeps, end-to-end convergence): point-by-point
  published-figure / NASA-data reproduction and speedline/choke traversal
  are `[VERIFY]`, blocked on the reference-library correlation calibration
  (every Lieblein coefficient is `[VERIFY]`) and the M5 continuation driver.
  Still-open carryovers deferred past M4 (not needed until in-blade/mixing
  data exists): moving `t_stations` validation into `ClosureFields`/
  `FrozenInputs` for in-blade schedules; an `assert_valid_schedule`
  contract-test helper (§7.3.4) with the first non-default
  `DistributionSchedule`.
- **M5** (Newton driver + continuation + BC switching, V9 operability) —
  closed. Ran as four reviewed sub-steps on `main`: (1) `drivers/newton.py`
  — global Newton over the pure `ResidualAssembler.residual` (§6.3): **dense**
  forward-difference Jacobian (the correctness baseline the ARCH-5.3
  colored-FD version must match column-for-column — recorded as the next
  optimization, not a prerequisite), Armijo line search with the
  crossing-streamline monotonicity guard folded in (closes the M2/M3 AD-10
  carryover for the Newton path), warm start mandatory. Measured quadratic:
  V1c in ~3 iterations vs. 15 classical. (2) `drivers/continuation.py`
  `solve_speedline` (§6.7) + `solve_classical` `warm_start` seed — choke→stall
  traversal, per-point warm start, cut-back, classical→Newton escalation,
  §6.6 annulus choke margin + mass-averaged PR, stall flags with recorded
  criterion (`solver_failure`/`pr_turnover`/`validity_saturated`). (3)
  `BackPressureSpec` residual form (§6.6): `mdot` joins the state, the
  assembler appends the throttling-station back-pressure row, `FrozenInputs`
  accepts it (the M2 stub-and-reject lifted); Newton solves it — round-trip
  verified against normal mode. Then the hysteretic choke↔normal BC-switch
  wired into the traversal (auto + logged + `c_sw`/`δ_hys` band, no
  limit-cycling). (4) `verification/v9_operability.py` (V9): surge-flag
  behaviour demonstrated on the V5 rotor line (`pr_turnover`), stable
  BC-switching-across-choke on a swirling-duct testbed (Appendix C.9). Two
  honest `[VERIFY]`s remain, both closure-library boundaries not driver ones:
  the V5 point-by-point surge-line match (reference data), and the *V5*
  choke-knee traversal onto the supersonic-`mdot` branch (the single-node
  continuity Jacobian is singular at the capacity peak — *reclassified at
  M6-4*, see M6 below: a compressor-shock + continuation matter, not the
  turbine milestone). The `machine/` facade's `warm_start` argument and the
  ARCH-6 reproducer-bundle serialization remain seams for later.
- **M6** (axial-turbine correlation set, V6) — closed. Ran as five reviewed
  sub-steps on `main`, mirroring M4's deviation→loss→set ordering: (1)
  `closures/axial_turbine/ainley.py` — throat-based exit angle
  `α2 = arccos(o/s)` (§4.5; the M2→1 limit of K-O), `AinleyTurbineSwirl`;
  added the `throat` opening to the §4.1 geometry contract (its first
  consumer; optional, raises loudly if a turbine closure asks and it's
  unset). (2) `kacker_okapuu.py` + `loss.py` — K-O **profile loss** (AM
  nozzle/impulse interpolation + t/c + Mach `K_p` + Reynolds `f_Re`), native
  B.3 `Y` converted to entropy at the B.1-re-referenced exit state (the
  exit-Mach/`p2` reference taken at the loss-free ideal exit state, no
  flow-view contract change); `KACKER_OKAPUU` CorrelationSet. (3) **secondary
  + trailing-edge loss** — K-O endwall `Y_s` (frame-safe signed-cascade
  loading; aspect-ratio factor) + TE kinetic-energy coefficient mapped to an
  equivalent `Y`; all components share the B.3 exit reference and sum to one
  conversion (B.5-compliant; using B.3 not B.4 for TE keeps the residual path
  exception-free, AD-10). `aspect_ratio`/`te_o_ratio` are row-scalar design
  inputs (annulus-derived AR is a refinement). (4) **inlet shock loss** — K-O
  transonic term `Y_shock = 0.75(M1−0.4)^1.75` in the profile bracket, C¹ via
  softplus; **V5 choke-knee revisited and reclassified** (measured: V5
  meanline chokes at `mdot ≈ 175` kg/s, a continuity-capacity singularity no
  loss closure moves; by AD-5 the *turbine* shock term doesn't apply to the
  Lieblein *compressor* set — the V5 traversal needs a *compressor* shock
  closure + the M5-3 back-pressure mode, a compressor-set/M8 matter). (5) V6
  axial-turbine entry point (`verification/v6_axial_turbine.py`, a pre-swirled
  reaction rotor) — **structural** like V5: converges at all three tiers,
  extracts real work (Δh0<0), de-swirls to near-axial exit, PR/η in sane
  bands (Appendix C.6). Point-by-point K-O validation-case reproduction and
  speedline/choke traversal are `[VERIFY]`, blocked on the reference-library
  correlation calibration (every K-O coefficient is `[VERIFY]`), as for V5.
  The K-O secondary Mach factor `K_s`, the shock geometric/pressure factors,
  and per-node Reynolds (a design-Re parameter stands in) are `[VERIFY]`
  deferrals; the `(1−Mm²)` relaxation factor recalibration stays open (M6+).
- **M7** (centrifugal: parametric-φ path, INBLADE stations, slip, V7) —
  closed. Ran as four reviewed sub-steps on `main`: (1)
  `closures/centrifugal/wiesner.py` — Wiesner slip σ = 1 − √(cos β₂ᵦ)/Z^0.7 +
  `WiesnerSlip` swirl closure (σU₂ − Vₘtanβ₂ᵦ exit swirl; the inducer sgn/
  backsweep sign resolved by probing to give compression, not the turbine
  tangle). (2) `centrifugal/loss.py` — incidence + skin-friction internal
  loss, each converted individually to Δs at the B.1-re-referenced exit
  static T via the new `conversions.delta_s_enthalpy_loss` (cp·ln(1+Δh/cpT));
  `CENTRIFUGAL` CorrelationSet. Blade-loading/clearance/disk-friction
  deferred (why V7 η reads ~0.98). (3) **INBLADE stations** — the driver
  `EDGE_TE=EDGE_LE+1` M7-stub lifted: `_resolve_rows` accepts EDGE_LE,
  INBLADE*, EDGE_TE on contiguous indices and derives `t_stations` (topology-
  fixed mean-anchor meridional fractions, AD-8), wiring the existing §3.4/3.5
  `row_steps` distribution across sub-intervals (classical + Newton rebuild
  sites); no residual-path change. `transport.assert_valid_schedule` (§7.3.4
  contract gate) closes the M4 carryover. **A.8 in-blade force
  `f_b,q = f_b,θ·tanλ` deferred** (zero for radial stacking; needs lean
  geometry + a master-ODE streamwise-gradient term). (4) V7 centrifugal
  entry point (`verification/v7_centrifugal.py`, backswept impeller,
  U₂=362 m/s) — **structural** like V5/V6 and the **first radial end-to-end**:
  converges all three tiers on the φ→90° path, does centrifugal work
  (Δh0>0, PR≈2.46), slipped exit swirl (Vθ/U₂≈0.68), radial exit r=r₂
  (Appendix C.7). **Measured finding**: Tier-3 full-SLC repositioning on the
  90° bend *requires* the INBLADE subdivision (`n_inblade=6`) — edge-only
  diverges the §6.4 odd-even mode at any relaxation and Newton inherits the
  stiff seed; this is the concrete physical reason radial rows want in-blade
  stations. Point-by-point Eckardt reproduction stays `[VERIFY]` (reference
  library + deferred loss), as for V5/V6. Still open past M7: the A.8 force;
  a robust radial-repositioning stabilization (the stable `n_inblade` pocket
  is narrow); blade-loading/clearance/disk loss components.
- **M8** (spanwise mixing, multistage V5 revisit, mixed-flow V8) — closed.
  Ran as four reviewed sub-steps on `main`: (1) `transport/mixing.py` — the
  §3.6 spanwise-mixing operator: implicit (backward-Euler in m, tridiagonal
  in q) diffusion of {h0,s,rVθ}, finite-volume with zero-flux walls so it
  **conserves** the mass-flux-weighted total and is **unconditionally
  stable**; `GallimoreMixing` default (`μ_mix = c_mix·ρ·Vm·r`, `c_mix=0.01`
  `[VERIFY]`); `FidelityConfig.mixing_term` flag (default 0 in ALL tiers incl.
  tier3(), so the §8 degeneracy / V3 identity is untouched). (2) wired into
  the classical driver's lagged field refresh (§6.2.2.4, AD-4) — never the
  residual path (AD-3); `mixing_term=0` is bit-identical to a plain solve even
  with a model supplied. (3) `V5MultistageCompressor` (2 repeating
  rotor+stator stages) — **measured: mixing is a convergence prerequisite for
  multistage axial, not a smoother**: mixing-off runs away to a ~40 J/(kg·K)
  spanwise entropy split and NUMERICAL_FAILUREs even at 800 iters; the shipped
  default mixing converges it (PR≈1.18, 50× less stratified) (Appendix C.5m).
  (4) `V8MixedFlow` (partial φ→55° bend, centrifugal set) — structural at
  Tier 1+2 (converges, compresses PR≈1.56, exits mixed-flow with
  r_LE<r_exit<r_c), Appendix C.8. **Measured: the V7 90°-bend Tier-3 pocket
  does NOT transfer to intermediate angles** — Tier-3 mixed-flow repositioning
  fails across a wide (n_sl,n_inblade,Ω) grid; pinned as a tripwire test. Open
  past M8: the robust radial/mixed **repositioning stabilization** (now the
  V8 Tier-3 blocker), `c_mix` calibration, the mixing entropy-production term
  (the operator redistributes s; the Δs_mix irreversibility source is a
  refinement), plus the standing M7 carryovers (A.8 force, centrifugal loss
  components). Per ARCH-8 this was the last milestone on the ladder.
- **Post-M8 independent audit + turbine-sign fix (2026-07).** A cold audit
  per `docs/audit_charter.md` independently confirmed the kernel numerics
  (A.5 master ODE, RK2 step, A.7 choke identity, V1d order 1.94 all
  reproduced) and found one correctness bug: the axial-turbine closures
  signed the exit angle by `orientation` = sign(**LE** metal angle), which
  flips the exit swirl — work *input* instead of extraction — for a reaction
  rotor with co-rotating relative inflow (β1 > 0, β2 < 0; LE/TE metal-angle
  signs legitimately differ, that is what turning is). Fixed:
  `ParamRowGeometry.orientation_te` (the **TE** turning direction, validated
  lazily like `throat` — β2 must be nonzero and single-signed across span
  only when a TE-keyed closure asks) now signs `AinleyTurbineSwirl` and the
  `KackerOkapuuLoss` cascade frame. `orientation` (LE-keyed) stays for
  Lieblein/Wiesner/incidence loss — **do not swap them**: Wiesner keyed to
  the TE would mis-handle forward-sweep (audited correct as-is).
  Behavior-preserving for every existing case (V6 has both angles negative;
  all turbine test geometries same-signed). Physics-anchored regressions
  (assert work extraction, not the closure's own formula):
  `test_ainley.py::test_reaction_rotor_corotating_inflow`,
  `test_kacker_okapuu.py::test_loss_reaction_rotor_opposite_sign_metal_angles`,
  plus `orientation_te` guard tests. Suite 351, gates green.
- **Post-M8 checker hardening (2026-07, audit follow-up).** The audit found
  both CI lint gates weaker than the decisions they claim to enforce; no
  live violations existed (the discipline held by convention), but the gates
  are now made real. `tools/check_ad6.py`: R1 patterns now match the
  injected **`xp.` spelling** as well as `np.` (the old patterns never
  matched the namespace the kernel routes through); R1 now covers
  **`transport/`** (flow-array schedules/mixing, §7.3 discipline), not just
  `closures/`; and a bare `# ad6: allow` with no justification text is
  itself a violation (R0) — waivers stay auditable. `tools/check_imports.py`:
  new **AD-5 firewall** on top of the direction rule — outside `closures/`
  only `closures.interfaces` and `closures.smoothmath` are importable
  (direction alone let `assembly` import Lieblein constants). Both tools'
  scan cores are pure functions with negative controls in
  `tests/test_lint_tools.py` (the CLAUDE.md checker rule applied to the
  checkers themselves: each rule proven to reject a known violation, plus
  end-to-end positive controls). Suite 372, gates green. Known remaining
  limits (recorded, not enforced): raw `if` on flow arrays is not textually
  detectable (human review per ARCH-4.2); `qo_capacity`-style np use in
  `assembly/` stays outside R1 by design (driver-facing, not residual path).
- **Post-M8 V7 tripwire (2026-07, audit follow-up).** The C.7 "edge-only
  Tier-3 diverges without INBLADE" measured finding was narrative-only
  (asymmetric with the V8 tripwire); now pinned in-suite:
  `test_v7_centrifugal.py::test_tier3_edge_only_is_the_measured_inblade_necessity`
  (`n_inblade=0`, Tier 3 → must NOT converge; flip the assertion when a
  robust radial repositioning stabilization lands). C.7 updated to name it.
  Suite 373.
- **Post-M8 Tier-3 radial/mixed stabilization (2026-07).** The top post-ladder
  open item, closed via diagnosis-first (scratchpad probes, root cause in
  memory). **The M7-4/M8-4 failure attribution was wrong**: not the §6.4
  odd-even repositioning mode (streamlines barely moved before death; pure
  repositioning+curvature on the V8 bend is stable; density irrelevant). The
  real chain: master-ODE $V_m=0$ singularity when a q-o integrates from
  vm_q0 stale vs. the transported fields (the *unrelaxed closure switch-on*
  being the main producer, amplified by the REE swirl term ~ rVθ/r² at
  low-radius mid-bend stations) → the driver fatally boundary-checked the
  stale-guess split the solves were about to repair (killed states proven
  solvable: cold re-solve |F|/ṁ = 4e-15) → `_solve_qo` accepted roots on
  spurious negative-Vm branches / at the −1e30 cliff. The V7 "pocket" and V8
  "angle-specificity" were chaos in whether transient garbage stayed finite.
  **Fixes (drivers/classical.py + assembler capacity guard):** (1) AD-10
  flow-field check moved to the *solved* state (broken metrics stay fatal);
  (2) continuity roots validated onto the strictly-positive branch (root
  validation, not endpoint vetting — endpoint vetting was measured to
  destabilize the V7 closure-lag trajectory); (3) transiently root-less q-o's
  freeze their boundary value, CHOKE_LIMITED only after `choke_patience=15`
  consecutive deficient iterations (window ≈ 2/closure_relax, measured 8 on
  V8); (4) the **first closure application relaxes from the duct baseline**
  through the same §6.2.4 rule as later ones. **Results:** V8 Tier 3
  converges (396 it, PR 1.587, few-% off Tier 2); V7 edge-only converges
  (173 it, PR 2.4433 vs. pocket 2.4540) — *the INBLADE-necessity claim is
  refuted* (stations remain the in-blade resolution choice); V7 pocket
  reproduces its old fixed point (197 it, PR 2.4540); multistage V5
  mixing-off now *converges* — **the M8-3 "mixing is a convergence
  prerequisite" claim was the same artifact**; the surviving physical claim
  (25× exit-entropy stratification without mixing, 17.6 vs 0.69 J/(kg·K)) is
  what `test_multistage_mixing` now pins. Both tripwires flipped; C.5m/C.7/
  C.8 revised; prescribed-closure exactness tests moved to closure-lag
  tolerance (ramp residual ~ tol_closure/closure_relax ≈ 4e-9 rel). Open
  follow-ups: Tier-3 radial/mixed is *slow* (ω_sl ≈ 0.066 throttle; Newton
  finishing / §6.4 recalibration on the blade-row-coupled family — C.3 was
  duct-calibrated and possibly artifact-contaminated); Newton path has no
  positive-branch guard yet (negative-Vm finite garbage passes its
  feasibility check); ln-Vm positivity-safe integration is the recorded
  principled root fix if new cases resurface it.
- **Post-M8 consolidation sprint (2026-07).** (1) **Newton positive-branch
  guard shipped**: `_safe_residual` now splits once, rejects trials whose
  integrated Vm is not strictly positive (spurious branches carry FINITE
  residuals — measured on plain V1c, not just bends), and evaluates the
  residual via the new `ResidualAssembler.residual_from(fields, x)` seam
  (no cost change); regression
  `test_newton.py::test_negative_vm_trial_is_infeasible_despite_finite_residual`.
  (2) **Newton finishing measured, not wired**: on V8 T3 the inner Newton is
  textbook (2-3 quadratic iterations/pass) but the quasi-Newton closure
  outer contracts at only ~0.73/pass after a ~4-pass hump → ~54 passes ×
  ~2.2 s (dense-FD Jacobian) ≈ 120 s vs classical's 75 s. Profitability
  gate = the ARCH-5.3 colored-FD Jacobian (~4× pass cost) or
  closure-in-Newton; don't wire escalation before one of those lands.
  (3) **§6.4 envelope headroom measured** (C.3 note): the duct-calibrated
  threshold is 2-3× conservative on blade-row bends — V8 identical answer at
  `wilkinson_c=13.2` in 152 iters (vs 396), diverges at 22; V7 halves at
  13.2. Default stays 4.4 pending a multi-family recalibration of
  `tools/calibrate_wilkinson.py`; per-case overrides safe to ~13 on
  V7/V8-class geometry.
- **Post-M8 colored-FD Jacobian (2026-07, ARCH-5.3 closed).** Default
  Newton Jacobian is now colored FD, **exact by construction** — validated
  column-for-column against the dense baseline in every configuration (the
  M5 bar). Measured structure (probes, recorded in the module docstring):
  `vm_q0` columns exactly block-diagonal at every tier → one color always;
  interior-q columns block-diagonal to FD noise ONLY with curvature/lean
  off AND `|sin(eps)|~0` (straight annulus — the cos ε sensitivity is
  second-order at ε=0), certified per solve by `_q_columns_groupable`; on
  bends the ε coupling is FIRST-order (measured 38% grouped error at Tier 2
  on V8!) and under curvature the spline couples stations globally
  (~0.27/station decay) — **the arch spec's "near-block-tridiagonal"
  premise is soft, not sparse**. A banded stride-6 approximate mode was
  built, measured (2.8% aliasing → ~1.7× more inner iterations → net
  LOSS end-to-end on V8 T3) and deliberately dropped. Shipped result:
  straight-annulus Tier-2/meanline Jacobians (the continuation/BP
  workhorse) 3.9× cheaper at 1.8e-8 agreement; curved/Tier-3 bit-exact
  with the free vm color (~1.2×). `jacobian="dense"` remains the escape
  hatch + automatic fallback. Newton-finishing profitability on radial/
  mixed Tier 3 therefore stays gated (the 4× hoped-for pass-cost cut is
  physically unavailable on curved paths without closure-in-Newton or a
  compact-support streamline fit — both recorded).
- **Post-M8 §6.4 multi-family recalibration (2026-07; C.3 revised,
  `tools/calibrate_wilkinson.py` extended with `[duct|bladerow|all]`).**
  Duct rerun post-stabilization **reproduces the C.3 fit exactly** (p=1.50,
  K=7.3; two near-threshold classifications softened x→slow-stable — the
  positive-branch guard removed the garbage-branch deaths at onset, mode
  unchanged). Blade-row family (V8 parametric bend, sweeping `wilkinson_c`
  itself — fixed-ω dies in the switch-on transient the adaptive (1−Mm²)
  factor rides out; `n_inblade` barely moves x, so points probe the
  constant, not the exponent): c* ∈ [8.8, ≥30] on converging points →
  **duct family binds, default 4.4 stands**; per-case overrides safe to
  ~13 on ib=6-class layouts. Two NEW measured open items at φ=55°
  (ib∈{2,12}, failing at every c, NOT envelope failures): the **freeze-
  fallback wedge** — a capacity-deficient exit-duct station frozen by the
  §6.6 patience fallback distorts its own repositioning targets and never
  gains the missing capacity (ib=2: false choke, 1200 patience-off iters
  sane-but-unconverged; ib=12: persistent ~3% deficiency with converged
  closures → Vm-singularity rupture at it 161). **Candidate fix
  (capacity-peak vm_q0) implemented, measured, REVERTED** — no-op on all
  passing cases, non-curative on the wedge. Deeper diagnosis (C.3,
  revised): these layouts settle into self-consistent lag states whose
  exit station has NO positive-branch root at mdot — ib=2 a stationary
  24.8% deficit that persists even with the ib=6 fixed point's closures
  PRESCRIBED (suspect: coarse-fit end-condition curvature at the exit);
  ib=12 a stationary surplus (lag-settled stratification, h0 span 22
  kJ/kg, s span 3→15 J/kgK, forces an REE shear whose MINIMUM feasible
  mass ≈ 28.8 > 12 kg/s at any boundary value). Recorded next attacks:
  closure-in-Newton on such states, an end-condition-aware/compact-support
  streamline fit, or documenting ib≈6 as the supported radial/mixed
  layout. Until then 55°-class bends with ib far from 6 are a
  known-unsupported region, honestly reported by typed statuses.
